    "**1. Project Overview: Leveraging Sentiment Analysis and Similarity Search to Optimize Product offerings and success**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past decade, there is an exponential growth in online purchases and E-commerce platforms. Hence, E-commerce platforms are tasked with figuring out how customers feel about their brand, the services and product they offer. The relationship between customer sentiments and factors that influence them is valuable. Sentiment analysis allows for product-customer fit, which translates to sales and profit. According to the Statista Research Department, by 2029, the revenue in the E-commerce market in the US is estimated to reach 1.9 trillion dollars. So despite the fierce competition, there’s a lot of opportunities in the E-commerce market. We want to take advantage of these opportunities by extracting data driven insights via customer text reviews to iteratively improve product-customer fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a 2024 survey that focus on the most profit Amazon sellers worldwid by product category from December 2023 to January 2024, the beauty and personal care category topped the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, for this project, we will focus on the beauty and personal care category for analysis of the text reviews to predict customer sentiment and product success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem statement is: **How might we… leverage user text reviews to identify product issues and prioritize features that customers value the most?**\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution is to use machine learning and NLP to analyze customer sentiment and extract insights. This will result in a Review Analyzer App for various stakeholders to enhance customer-product fit and satisfaction with data-driven product insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, given the limited computational power of my personal computer, I will subset the dataset to 1% (165674, 16) and utilize Google Colab for mapping text to 384-dimension embeddings via the Sentence Transformer model ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')."
