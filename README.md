# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

### Describe your project (big idea)
-Leveraging text data to predict customer sentiment and product success

### Describe your goal
-In the past decade, there is an exponential growth in online purchases and E-commerce platforms. Hence, Ecommerce platforms are tasked with figuring out how customers feel about their brand, the services and product they offer. The relationship between customer sentiments and factors that influence them is valuable. Sentiment analysis allows for product-customer fit, which translates to sales and profit. According to the Statista Research Department, by 2029, the revenue in the e-commerce market in the US is estimated to reach 1.9 trillion dollars. So despite the fierce competition, thereâ€™s a lot of opportunities in the e-commerce market. We want to take advantage of these opportunities by extracting data driven insights via customer sentiment to iternatively improve product-customer fit. 

### Describe your data
-For my capstone, I will be using an Amazon Review dataset from UCSD (https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/index.html#).
-The Amazon review dataset is a rich, relatively clean dataset. There are many categories of products to choose from. I conducted my EDA on the beauty category and intend to expand to other categories as a next step. 

### Describe your work (models, analysis, EDA, etc.)
From basic EDA, the following insights were extracted: 
-The distribution of rating is a bit skewed towards higher ratings. 
-When looking at total number of ratings by years from 2003 to 2023, there is a dramatic increase after 2017, which was when Amazon launched the "Early Reviewer Program" that incentivized customers with gift cards to leave product reviews. This highlights the importance E-commerce giants are placing on customer reviews and customer sentiment for business success and growth. 
-When looking at a preliminary extraction of the top 20 positive and negative sentiments from the reviews. We can potenitally gather insights on what is currently working well and what are potential areas of improvement. 

### Describe your results
-We are still in the preliminary EDA phase, but below are next steps for the projects.
1. EDA on other categories from the Amazon Customer Review dataset, with the focus on distribution of user ratings, top sentiment phrases, and to increase the diversity of category training set.
2. More in-depth text data analysis techniques, with the focus on a. Sentiment via counting sequence of words, n-grams, b. Word embeddings to create features that group similar words to handle synonyms c. Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaning
